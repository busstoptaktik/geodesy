### Abstract

```sh
$ echo 55 12 | kp "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> 691875.6321 6098907.8250 0.0000 0.0000
```

### Prologue

`kp` is the Rust Geodesy **coordinate processing** program. The obvious abbreviation of coordinate processing is `cp`, but since `cp` is the Unix file copying program we substitute k for c - hence `kp`, which may be taken as a reference to the Danish word for coordinate processing **koordinatprocessering**.

Incidentally, `kp` was also the user-id and email address of the late **Knud Poder** (1925-2019), during his work years at the Danish geodetic institute, GI (and its successor, KMS), from the 1950s until his retirement in 1995.

For many years, Poder was in charge of the GI department for computational geodesy where, for some years around 1980, his deputy was Carl Christian Tscherning (1942-2014), for whom the [PROJ](https::/proj.org) transformation program [cct](https://proj.org/apps/cct.html) was named. Among friends, colleagues and collaborators worldwide, Knud Poder was regarded a Nestor of computational geodesy.

### Usage

The basic operation of `kp` is very simple. Any complexity in `kp` usage is related to the description of the operation to carry out, which is the subject of [Rumination 002](/ruminations/002-rumination.md). The `kp` command line syntax is:

```sh
kp "operation" file1 file2 ...
```

or, with input from `stdin`:

```sh
echo coordinate | kp "operation"
```

or, with output to the file `result`:

```sh
kp -o result "operation" file1 file2 ...
```

### Examples

Convert the coordinate tuple (55 N, 12 E) from geographical coordinates  on the GRS80 ellipsoid to Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 32 coordinates on the same (implied) ellipsoid:

```sh
$ echo 55 12 0 0 | kp "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> 691875.6321 6098907.8250 0.0000 0.0000
```

While RG coordinates are always 4D, `kp` will provide zero-values for any left-out postfix dimensions:

```sh
$ echo 55 12 | kp "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> 691875.6321 6098907.8250 0.0000 0.0000
```

The `roundtrip` option measures the roundtrip accuracy of a transformation
(i.e. how close to the origin you end up after a forward+inverse dance). Knud Poder championed this practise with his ingeniously constructed *Poder dual autochecking* method, which was essential at a time where computers were less robust than today (more about that [below](#a-few-more-words-about-knud-poder)).

```sh
$ echo 55 12 | kp --roundtrip "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> 55 12:  d = 0.05 mm
```

The `inv` option runs the specified pipeline inversely:

```sh
$ echo 691875.6321 6098907.8250 | kp --inv "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> 54.9999999996 11.9999999994 0.00000 0.00000
```

The `inv` and `roundtrip` options are mutually exclusive:

```txt
$ echo 691875.6321 6098907.8250 | kp --inv --roundtrip "geo:in | utm zone=32"
> Options `inverse` and `roundtrip` are mutually exclusive
> error: process didn't exit successfully: ...
```

### Options

The `help` option gives the list of options:

```txt
$ kp --help
kp 0.7.1
KP: The Rust Geodesy "Coordinate Processing" program.
Called `kp` in honor of Knud Poder (1925-2019), the
nestor of computational geodesy, who would have found
it amusing to know that he provides a reasonable
abbreviation for something that would otherwise have
collided with the name of the Unix file copying program `cp`

USAGE:
    kp.exe [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <OPERATION> [FILE]...

FLAGS:
    -d, --debug        Activate debug mode
    -e, --echo         Echo input to output
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -i, --inv          Inverse. Use of `inverse` mode excludes the use
                       of `roundtrip` mode
    -r, --roundtrip    Roundtrip mode - a signature feature of Knud
                       Poder's programs: Evaluate the accuracy of the
                       transformation by comparing the input argument
                       with its supposedly identical alter ego after
                       a forward+inverse transformation pair. Use of

### A few more words about Knud Poder

On the occasion of Knud Poder's 90th birthday in 2015, I wrote a few words about one of his accomplishments on the [PROJ mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2015-October/006884.html):

> As described in a recent thread, for the next release, proj.4 will switch the default transverse mercator implementation from tmerc to etmerc.
>
> This is probably a good occasion to reiterate the history of the code for the etmerc implementation - especially since the original author, Knud Poder, turned 90 on October 19th. Having his transverse mercator implementation becoming the proj.4 default is a strikingly proper way of celebrating Poder, among colleagues and collaborators rightfully considered “the Nestor of computational geodesy”.
>
> Poder wrote the first version of what is now known as etmerc, around 1961. It was written in Algol-60 and ran on the GIER computer, built for the Danish Geodetic Institute (see [1] for details).
>
> The code was based on theoretical foundations published a decade earlier, by König & Weise ([2], building on prior work by Krüger, 1912 [3]).
>
> Poder’s work was characterized by great care with respect to numerical precision and accuracy (e.g. by using Clenshaw summation for recurrence series, and Horner’s scheme for polynomial evaluation).
>
> Also, Poder was noted for his ingeniously implemented “dual autochecking method” (not used in the proj.4 version), where the same code was used for forward and inverse projections and was run both ways and compared, to protect against both coding and hardware errors. The latter was very important at a time where the mean time between failure for computer systems was much shorter than today.
>
> During the 1970s Poder’s student, Karsten Engsager (the “E” in etmerc, “Engsager Extended Transverse Mercator”) took over maintenance and eventually extended König and Weise’s numerical series by another term, bringing the accuracy up to today’s standard.
>
> In 2008, through the efforts of a.o. Gerald Evenden, Frank Warmerdam and Karsten Engsager, etmerc was introduced in proj.4, while in 2013 Charles Karney provided 3 corrections - stressing the value and importance of open source code sharing.
>
> Poder retired 20 years ago, but has been taking active interest in the maintenance and development of his code ever since. Switching proj.4 to use a transverse mercator implementation based on his work is probably the best conceivable way of celebrating the 90th birthday of a great Nestor of computational geodesy.
