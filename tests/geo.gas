GAS - Geodetic grid Authoring System, sample file for testing
-------------------------------------------------------------

The GAS format aims at being a human-readable, as well as
human-writable, widely applicable format, for geodetic grids
in 1-4 dimensions (i.e. from static profiles to time series
of 3D grids), and 1-8 bands, i.e. from static geoid models
to time-varying 4D-corrections.

GAS is NOT a format for final grids. It is a format for
exploratory development of new grids - potentially written
by hand, or in whole/part by any tool able to write a
string of characters to a file.

To facilitate experimentation and documentation, everything
preceding the "header" line below is considered comments,
and ignored by the grid reading software. So any thoughts,
back-of-envelope estimates, informal documentation, etc. may
go here.

Also, all whitespace is collapsed into a single delimiter,
and everything between a hashmark ('#') and the following
end-of-line is ignored.

All-in-all, this provides for a verbose, but highly versatile
format trying hard not to get in the way of the geodesist
at work.
